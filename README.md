# JS no-webpack Template

Welcome to our Javascript template meant to be used for [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/)'s projects on JS (before webpack)!
Generate your JS project the easy way!


## Features

* Setup a basic VanillaJS app with a single script or few commands
* Makes LESS ready to use with all its benefits
* Lets us use JS modules and ES6+ available for most browsers
* Ready made examples on CSS and Less
* Sets `stickler` on the repo
* Sets `eslint` rules
* Example of Web Components
* Gives you a great README to start with
* Easy to generate projects in GitHub
* Meant to be useful for Microverse students and anyone that wants a JS' Apps (no webpack)

# Pre Requisites

The script requires you to have:

- Some compatible Linux OS (We tested on Debian/Ubuntu derivatives)
- `nodejs` latest LTS version
- `git` and normal development stuff
- Basic terminal and script knowledge
- Some common sense

Now, this is meant to be used as a [GitHub Template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template),
so please don't clone this repository (unless you want to collaborate), 
use [this button](https://github.com/Israel-Laguan/HTML-LESS-JS-no-webpack-starter/generate) instead.

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/Israel-Laguan/HTML-LESS-JS-no-webpack-starter/generate" target="_blank">
        <img src="doc/template-button.png">
    </a>
</div>

## Creating a new project

After you used the template in your project, clone your project in you PC and 
open a terminal inside your project, like this: 

```
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <Your-project>
````

First run the [script](run_me.sh) provided:

```
chmod -x ./run_me.sh
bash ./run_me.sh
```

In VS Code, Ctrl + Shift + X
Search ESLint
Install ESLint
Restart VS Code
<!-- https://travishorn.com/setting-up-eslint-on-vs-code-with-airbnb-javascript-style-guide-6eb78a535ba6 -->
Last but not least the script remove this README and substitute for the renamed [README.TEMPLATE](README.TEMPLATE.md) (meant to be used for _Microverse Projects_), so if you are running each command instead of using the script make the change of READMEs manually.
